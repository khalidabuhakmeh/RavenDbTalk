## Note

To run the Web sample, be sure you are running RavenDB on http://localhost:8080 and be sure to import the Quotely data from Quotely.ravendump found in the data folder. The database should be called Quotely.

If you've never imported data before follow these steps (after you have RavenDB running).

1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Click the **Tasks** button.
3. Click **Import Database** in the left hand side.
4. Click **Import Database** button
5. Select the file to import from data/Quotely.ravendump

Indexes will be pushed into the database the first time your run the web application. Be patient while the indexes build, it might take a few minutes.
